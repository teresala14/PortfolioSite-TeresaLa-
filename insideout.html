            During the research portion of my project, I conducted three
            interviews with users ranging from late 20s-early 30s. The objective
            is to determine the
            <b

              habits they currently have, and goals and struggles in regard to

            well as identify the current digital resources they are using to
            narrow the scope of the project.

              tests were conducted with participants ranging from their 20s-30s
              with knowledge of how to use mobile apps. The goal of this study
              is to measure how difficult the users find accomplishing tasks
              using the main features of the app.
